## Usage

Once you have installed iRealm, you can use it to automate your Kerberos setup. Follow these steps:

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the downloaded file. This will initiate the setup process.
2. **Follow Prompts**: The script will guide you through the necessary configurations.

### Example Command

```bash
./iRealm.sh
```

## Configuration

iRealm allows for some customization based on your environment. You can modify the configuration files as needed. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Edit `/etc/hosts`**: Ensure that your DC's hostname and IP address are correctly listed.
2. **Modify `krb5.conf`**: Update the realm and KDC information as required for your setup.

### Sample `krb5.conf`

```ini
[libdefaults]
    default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    dns_lookup_kdc = true

[realms]
    EXAMPLE.COM = {
        kdc = kdc.example.com
        admin_server = kdc.example.com
    }

[domain_realm]
    .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
    example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
```
